<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
    The <em>LST Processing Tool</em> allows to calculate Land Surface Temperatures
    from a synergetic approach, given overlapping MERIS/AATSR Level 1b product.
    This tool also provides a simulation mode which supports as input selected
    OLCI/SLSTR L1 simulation datasets. The processor was developed in the frame of
    the ESA Sen4LST project.
</p>

<h3>Algorithms</h3>

<p>
    The underlying algorithms are presented in detail in the corresponding
    ATBDs [1], [2], and summarized in the Processor Technical Specification
    document [3].
